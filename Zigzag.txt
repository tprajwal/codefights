The zig zag of an array is another array consisting of elements that represent the number of consecutive rises and falls, starting with the rises.

A rise is a pair of consecutive elements ni, ni+1, such that ni < ni+1. Similarly, a fall is pair of consecutive elements ni, ni+1, such that ni > ni+1.

Find the zig zag of the given array.

Example:

For n = [1,0,4,5] we have ZigZag(n) = [0,1,2]
Zig zag starts with no rise, followed by one fall (1 -> 0) and two raises (0 -> 4 and 4 -> 5).

For n = [1,9,4,7,2,0,1,2,9] we have ZigZag(n) = [1,1,1,2,3]

[input] array.integer n

Array of integers. It is guaranteed that each two consecutive elements are different. |n| > 2.
[output] array.integer

The zig zag of n.
